/* Function extract_numbers
 * 
 * Arguments:   input, character pointer corresponding to null-terminated input string to extract numbers from
 *              input should be in the format of AxB, where A and B are numbers corresponding to row and col, respectively
 *              row and col, integer pointers that allow for accessing both the inputted row and col
 * Returns:     integer, indicating if inputted move was valid
 *              (row and col could be read and are both non-negative)
 * Description: Extracts two numbers from STDIN based on user input.
 *              Reads input from user indicating a row and column for move (in the format RowxCol)
 *              Errors if both numbers are not inputted in this form or if either is negative
