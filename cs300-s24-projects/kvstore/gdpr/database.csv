put post_1 Quarantine til July sounds like a bunch of bullshit. I’m sorry. It’s a virus.
put post_2 I get it. I respect it. But at the same time, even if everybody gets it, yeah, people are going to die, which is terrible, but inevitable?
put post_3 Today, I’m honored to announce my candidacy for reelection here in Rhode Island’s 1st Congressional District. Watch my launch video, then pitch in a grassroots donation to help power this campaign to victory! Please like & RT to spread the word.
put post_4 In reflecting on my previous comments, I realize that my words about the quarantine and the virus were not expressed with the empathy and understanding Rhode Islanders deserved. I deeply apologize to anyone I may have upset or offended. The virus has impacted us all in profound ways, and I fully acknowledge the seriousness of this pandemic. I understand the necessity of quarantine measures and respect the efforts of healthcare professionals and scientists working tirelessly to keep us safe. As I seek your support for my candidacy in Rhode Island’s 1st Congressional District, I am committed to learning from my past and working hard to represent our shared interests and concerns. Together, we can ensure a healthier, safer future for all. #RI01
put post_5 lowkey doesn't really matter that kirby said that stuff about the virus. we were all thinking it
put post_6 Pretty horrific that Congressperson Kirby went all in on virus denial, even if it was years back. #NotMyCongressperson
put post_7 Sarsra Breisand spotted at her cliff-top residence in Malibu, California on Zumirez Dr!
put post_8 Fascinating to reflect on the Breisand Effect and the way it's inspired cutting-edge research on psychological reactance!
put post_9 see u in malibu sarsra!!! lmao
put post_10 paparazzi are scum. delete this
put post_11 crazy to see the titular instance of the breisand effect lol
put post_12 So so proud of the amazing cast and crew that were able to make our new film, Total Menace, possible. See it in theaters this Friday!!
put post_13 Hilarious to see whatsherface starring as a communist revolutionary when she once told me that ""maybe its not a bad thing that ppl in poor districts dont turn out for elections""...she really is a total menace.
put post_14 are we really shocked to hear that Angel Yoline, the highest paid actress of the 2010s, hates poor people? im not
put post_15 Angel has a point. I think people should be required to have some sort of baseline education before they're able to vote...look at the state of our country.
put post_16 @user_15 not shocked that you've missed yet another month of child support...
put post_17 For those that follow me, just wanted to address the claims levied by my ex-wife. I was going through a really tough time — I didn't have a reliable source of income or housing — so I missed a child support payment. I've since landed a great job and paid what I owed. I regret missing a payment, but I really don't think Tweeter is the place to discuss this.
put post_19 It's official. First day of the rest of my life. Brown University Track and Field commit! Ivy League bound!
put post_20 HELLO EVERYBODY. PLEASE STOP SPREADING MY ADDRESS. I HAVE TAKEN LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THOSE WHO SHARED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. LOVE.
put post_21 @brownusports don't put sexual assaulters on your team. wouldnt want to catch that game #DELETEMATTBLEAT
